# CodeCap

**CodeCap** is a tiny visual undo tree UI experiment. Every editor operation is saved, including keystrokes, cursor movements, and selections.

Try the [Live Demo](https://rawgit.com/mhuebert/CodeCap/master/index.html) - you may wish to download a [sample file](https://cdn.rawgit.com/mhuebert/CodeCap/master/samples/codecap-sample-1.json) which you can open from within the editor.

- Explore history by hovering over the history bars at the top of the page
- Click on a historical position to begin editing "in the past" â€” a new branch will automatically be created. 
- Save named snapshots by right-clicking anywhere in a history bar, or click +Snapshot 
- Right-click on a snapshot to rename it

When you click on a saved snapshot in the sidebar, the editor will animate to that position.

CodeCap was built by Matthew Huebert at [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com) in 2014.
